Your goal is to take the key to move to the next level. Use you keyboard arrow keys to move on the board. Take care of the ladybugs they are in a very big hurry. If you get hit by a ladybug you will loose one of your life.
You lose the game if you have no more lifes. You don't lose life if you fall in the water. Use this trick in your advantage.
In some levels you will find rocks. Try to push the rock in the water to make a bridge. If you will push the rock towards the wall it will change it's position with yours.
